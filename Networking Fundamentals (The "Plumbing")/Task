ou cannot manage the Cloud or Kubernetes if you don't understand how packets move. Today is about IP Addressing and Ports.

The Scenario:
You are told that a web server is running on a Linux VM, but you can't see the website in your browser. You need to verify if the server is actually listening and if the "plumbing" is connected.

Your Tasks:
Identify your IP: Find your internal IP address on your AlmaLinux VM using the command line (don't use ifconfig, it's deprecated—use the ip toolset).

Check the "Listeners": Use ss or netstat to find all services currently listening for connections. Identify which PID is listening on port 22 (SSH).

Local Connectivity: Use the curl command to see if you can reach localhost on port 80. If it fails, explain the error code you get.

The Question:
What is the difference between a Public IP and a Private IP, and why do we use NAT (Network Address Translation) in a VPC?

What is the "Loopback" address, and what is its specific IP?

Show me the commands you used and the outputs. If you get an error, don't just say "it failed"—show me the specific error message.
